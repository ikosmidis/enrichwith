The packaged data set was downloaded in \code{.dat} format
    from \url{http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~aa/glm/data}. The latter
    link provides the data sets used in Agresti (2015).

    The endometrial data set was first analysed in Heinze and
    Schemper (2002), and was originally provided by Dr
    E. Asseryanis from the Medical University of Vienna.
