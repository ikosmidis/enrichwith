# enrichwith 0.05

## Bug fixes
* Fixed bug when passing a vector of options in the `with` argument of `enrich` methods
* Fixed a bug that would return wrong results if the `bias` function was passed a named vectors

## New functionality

## Other improvements, updates and additions
* Added d,p,q and enriched_glm in the vignette
* Documentation updates

# enrichwith 0.04

## Bug fixes
* p,q,d model: if data is missing then the model frame is used
* Fixed error message in qmodel

## New functionality
* Added `get_dmodel_function`, `get_pmodel_function`, `get_qmodel_function`
* `enriched_glm` can now be used to fit GLMs and get objects that are
  enriched with auxiliary functions and other components when compared
  to their `glm` counterparts

## Other improvements, updates and additions
* Fixed typos in `?enrich.family`
* Added documentation for `get_dmodel_function.glm`,
  `get_pmodel_function.glm`, `get_qmodel_function.glm`

# enrichwith 0.03

## Bug fixes
* Took care of aliasing in bias calculations
* Names of score and bias components do not get a prefix anymore
* Fixed a bug on argument of information function (part of the "auxiliary functions" enrichment option)
* Fixed a bug when testing the simulation methods

## New functionality
* Provide enrich capabilities for `lm` objects
* Score functions (?get_score_function) now accept `contributions = TRUE` for getting score contributions
* Provide the get_*_function convenience methods (e.g. get_score_function, get_information_function, get_bias_function)
* Provide the dmodel, pmodel, qmodel auxiliary functions for glm objects, to compute d, p, q based on a supplied data frame

## Other improvements, updates and additions
* Various codebase improvements
* Various documentation improvements
* New vignette for enriching `glm` objects
* Updated README file

# enrichwith 0.02

* Fixed an issue with the example in ?enrich.glm
* Minor codebase improvements
* Harmonised the output of the functions in the auxiliary_functions component of enriched `glm` objects
* More detailed descriptions for the enrichment options for `glm` objects
* Included a vignette on how bias-reduction for GLMs can be implemented using enriched `glm` objects

# enrichwith 0.01

* First release
