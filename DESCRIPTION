Description: The enrichwith package provides the "enrich" method to
    extend core objects with extra, relevant components. The current
    version has methods for enriching objects of class "family" and
    "link-glm". The resulting objects preserve their class, so the
    methods associated to them still apply. The package also provides
    facilities to streamline the authoring "enrichwith" templates for
    objects of arbitrary class
